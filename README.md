### Additional Resources of Mine

These resources are related to ideas of mine, mainly associated with the movie _Minority Report_ to understand how Anomaly detection unfolds in real or a futuristic life scenario and to pinpoint its opportunities and vulnerabilities. The movie sets a context that allows me to discover new ideas regarding to the research of SOM or Anomaly detection in general. These resources may or may not be incorporated into the lab activities and/or my thesis.
